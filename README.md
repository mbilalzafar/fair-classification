# Fairness in Classification

 
This repository provides a logistic regression implementation in python for the fair classification mechanisms introduced in our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05259" target="_blank">AISTATS'17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08452" target="_blank">WWW'17</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00010" target="_blank">NIPS'17</a> papers.

Specifically:

1. The <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05259" target="_blank">AISTATS'17 paper</a> [1]  proposes mechanisms to make classification outcomes free of disparate impact, that is, to ensure that similar fractions of people from different demographic groups (e.g., males, females) are accepted (or classified as positive) by the classifier. More discussion about the disparate impact notion can be found in Sections 1 and 2 of the paper.


2. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08452" target="_blank">WWW'17 paper</a> [2]  focuses on making classification outcomes free of disparate mistreatment, that is, to ensure that the misclassification rates for different demographic groups are similar. We discuss this fairness notion in detail, and contrast it to the disparate impact notion, in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the paper.


2. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00010" target="_blank">NIPS'17 paper</a> [3]  focuses on making classification outcomes adhere to preferred treatment and preferred impact fairness criteria. For more details on these fairness notions, and how they compare to existing fairness notions used in ML, see Sections 1 and 2 of the paper.

#### Dependencies 
1. [numpy, scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) if you are only using the mechanisms introduced in [1].
2. Additionally, if you are using the mechanisms introduced in [2] and [3], then you also need to install [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) and [DCCP](https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp).
